.SH NAME
calctime \- calculate time intervals from 
.B logtime(1)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B calctime [OPTIONS] [FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B calctime 
calculates time intervals from a list of start and stop times,
one per line,
from
.B FILE
(by default in the logtime config directory \(em see
.B FILES
below, and 
.B -i FILE
).
Output defaults to minutes.
It is primarily intended to parse files generated by 
.B logtime(1).
.SH INPUT FORMAT
Acceptable time format is:
.B YYYY-[M]M-[D]D-[h]h-[m]m-[AM|PM]  [# COMMENT]
\(em that is,
zero\(hypadding is optional,
12 or 24 hour formats are acceptable (but 12 hours must have AM or PM),
and where '-' is any of space, colon, or hyphen.
A time may be followed by a comment, 
which is disregarded.
Optional delimiter lines may separate stop times from start times.
Delimiter lines may be specified by a regex, 
but otherwise default to blanks,
or only spaces or hyphens.
Comment lines begin with a hash
.B #,
or spaces followed by a hash.
Comments may appear anywhere and are disregarded entirely.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.B --status
put whether the last clock was "in" or "out" on standard out.
Put errors on standard error, 
but do not produce any other output.
Mostly intended for scripting rather than interactive use.
.LP
.B -i FILE
read 
.B FILE
(relative or absolute path)
rather than 
.B FILE
in the config directory.
.LP
.B -v
be verbose \(em
show results as hours, minutes, number of intervals, 
and mean, median, and shortest lengths.
.LP
.B -vv
be very verbose \(em
output each interval in minutes.
This option is not exclusive of,
and does not imply, 
.B -v.
.LP
.B -r REGEXP
Use
.B REGEXP
as a record separator between start\(hystop tuplets,
rather than the default /^[-\\s]*$/.
Record separators are entirely optional, 
but make reading the input file much easier.
